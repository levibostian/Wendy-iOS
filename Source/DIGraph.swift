/*
 Dependency Injection Graph.

 Features:
 * Get an instance of a class. As easy as: `DIGraph.shared.foo` to get a strongly typed instance.
 * Register overrides for testing. In tests, run `DIGraph.shared.overrideFoo(instance)` and the next time code requests an instance of `foo`, your override will be used.
 * Easily reset all dependencies in the codebase as convenience for tests. In test tearDown call: `DIGraph.shared.reset()` and all overrides, instances, and singletons in the codebase will be reset to their original state.

 The code for the DIGraph is automatically generated. You inherit one of the provided protocols to your class.

 The DIGraph will detect your Singleton and register it with the graph.

 If you are wanting to create a dependency that can be injected in the DIGraph that's not a singleton,
 at this time, you do not inherit a protocol but instead add a comment above your class.
